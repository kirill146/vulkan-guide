# Project Ascendant
In this chapter, we will be looking at Project Ascendant, a open world voxel RPG prototype made on top of VKGuide showcasing how the tutorial code can be grown into a real game engine. Similar to the GPU Driven chapter, it showcases a way forward for the engine, but does not go into full detail of the code, as its not a walkthrough.
